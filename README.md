# Instrulator

Installer script for fresh or not-so-fresh Ubuntu installs.
Use it to install all (or at least some) of your favorite programs automatically while leaning
back in your comfortable chair, with an ice cold beer in your hand.

## How-to

Download the script:  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/draperunner/instrulator/master/instrulator.sh`  
Make it executable:  
`chmod +x instrulator.sh`  
Run it with sudo  
`sudo bash instrulator.sh`  
(Optional) Delete it after you're done  
`rm instrulator.sh`


## Testing

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2. Run `vagrant up` from project folder.
